# Overview
The Tableau workbook James Midkiff Example Tableau presents an interactive summary data analysis of employees with disabilities and of applicants who have disabilities or are veterans at the company “Continued Wellness” (“CW”). James Midkiff created this workbook as a template for corporate clients who would specify the analysis groups that would be most meaningful to use with their data. James and other analysts would then customize the workbook to each client’s needs. 

Both the data and the company “Continued Wellness” are fake. 

Viewing the Tableau workbook requires either an active Tableau license or the free software Tableau Reader. You can download Tableau Reader here:

# Disability Utilization dashboard: 
* This dashboard displays the following information for “CW” employees: 
    * The percentage of employees who have disabilities out of all employees in the AAP (Affirmative Action Plan). The term IWD (individuals with disabilities) may also be used. 
    * The percentage of employees who have disabilities out of those who responded to CW’s survey asking if they have disabilities
    * The percentage of employees who responded to CW’s survey. 
* The analysis scope is a company’s AAPs (Affirmative Action Plans).  AAPs are a legal term generally equivalent to a company location with 50 or more employees, or a grouping of several smaller company locations. 
* The user can disaggregate the data into one of several analysis units: 
    * AAP-Wide - One group of all employees in the AAP
    * Job Group - A legal term that generally groups employees with similar job responsibilities and compensation. 
    * EEO-1 Category - A legal term that groups several related Job Groups together. 
* Note that analysis units can be filtered with the slider to only view those of a certain size. 

# Data Metrics Non-DV Dashboard
* This dashboard displays the following information for applicants to “CW” job openings: 
    * The percentage of applicants in 2021 who responded to CW’s disability and veteran surveys. 
    * The percentage of applicants who responded they have a disability or are a veteran out of those who responded to the surveys. 
    * The percentage of applicants who responded they have a disability or are a veteran out of all applicants to CW.
    * The percentage of hires in 2021 who have a disability or are a veteran out of all hires at CW that year. 
    * The percentage of hires in 2021 who have a disability or are a veteran out of all applicants to CW that year who indicated they have a disability or are a veteran. 
        * This is also compared to the number of hires in 2021 who indicated they do not have a disability or are not a veteran relative to the number of applicants who indicated they do not have a disability or are not a veteran. 
* This data can also be viewed by each AAP.
